    <h2>TTRPGS</h2>
    <p>What are ttrpgs? Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">here</a> to find out!</p>
    <h3>Why do I like TTRPGs?</h3>
    <p>TTRPGs bring me and my friends to the table and tie us together through roleplay
        as we embody characters akin to actors embodying roles and deal with situations
        we wouldn't ordinarily be able to deal with.
